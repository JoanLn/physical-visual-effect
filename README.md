# Physically-Based visual effect
 This is a showcase of a Physically-Based visual effects project, advised by Professor Jerry Tessendorf at Clemson University. 
 The project uses multiple techniques to render 3D graphics

## 	Humanoid avatar 

  Creating a chracter by volume fields, which are rendering based on ray- tracing method and implicit functions. Combines different parts by constructive solid geometry operations.
